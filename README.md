# This is a repository for LaBEVir R scripts:

## 002R108_Sequence_GeneIdentificationUsingReferenceGenome: 
This script aligns user-provided sequences to a reference genome of moderate length, 
identifies the corresponding gene for each sequence, and adds this information to a metadata file. It also generates specific sub-alignments 
for each gene found (output: *_alignments.fasta)
